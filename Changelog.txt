Changelog

1.0.8
    Adoption by linuxgurugamer
    Thanks to user @angel-125 for the following:
        Updates configs for latest Blueshift:
            Updates warp rings to latest Blueshift standard
            Adds ModuleManager config to identify that the IXSWarpshipBlueshift mod exists
            Updates IXS parts to be included in Blueshift Community Category.
            Updates FTL tank to use WBIResources instead of deprecated WildBlueTools
            Updates Waterfall effects to Blueshift standard.
            Updates warp curves to the latest Blueshift standard.

        KNOWN ISSUE: Waterfall wasn't working before and still appears to not be working with the separate MODEL config. It's unknown if I can make this work properly; Waterfall is very cantankerous. But at least it works fine with Firefly. :)
